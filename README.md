#### Setup: 
- clone the respository
- npm install

#### Quesitons:
  There are several modules within the `src` directory. Each file has a problem to solve. 
  
#### Tests:
  Each module has a corresponding test file that validates the results of the solved problem. You can run all of the tests once by running `npm test`. You can run all of the tests by running `npm run test:watch` this will rerun all of the tests after any file is saved.
  Because this can be a little verbose, you can run a test watcher for only the module you're working on. Look at the `scripts` property in `package.json` to see what module tests are available. For example, `npm run test:isogram` will run only the tests for the isogram module and rerun them every time the file is saved.
